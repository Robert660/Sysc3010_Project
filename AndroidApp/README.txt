Included in GitHub is the src files for the Adroid Application
To test the app, you can either create a new project then overwrite the src directory with the one from gitHub

The other way is to install the apk file on a mobile device and run the program. It won't work in any condition since
the login and register are based on a local databse that must be running at the same time. 

The only other workaround is to install mySQL and Xamp and place the php files in the correct file paths seen below:

register.php belongs in  C:\xampp\htdocs\"register.php" same goes for other php

Then to change the ip of the databse from the app you need to click twice underneath the register user button(it is invisible)
then enter the ip:port of the server computer.
